# Chrome Native Messaging
Extensions and apps can exchange messages with native applications using an API that is similar to the other message passing APIs. Native applications that support this feature must register a native messaging host that knows how to communicate with the extension. Chrome starts the host in a separate process and communicates with it using standard input and standard output streams.
